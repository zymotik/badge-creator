# How to Use this Application

## Microsoft Windows:

1. Add names to the `pass-list.xlsx` file, paying special attention to the pass type column: this should only be one of the following options `Early`, `Backstage` or `Early & Backstage`.
2. Double click the `badge-creator-win.exe` file to generate printable files.
3. When the program completes, look inside the `./export` folder for a list of PDF files generated.
4. To print on the back side of these passes, turn the pages over and print again with the `./templates/back-of-pass.pdf` PDF file.
